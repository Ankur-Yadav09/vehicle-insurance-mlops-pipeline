Issue 1: 
The issue

Conda works by injecting a PowerShell hook so that conda activate and conda deactivate behave properly.
Normally, when you run:
conda init powershell

Conda writes some code into your PowerShell profile ($PROFILE) that auto-loads this hook whenever you open PowerShell.
In your case, Condaâ€™s files (conda-hook.ps1, Conda.psm1, etc.) were already present (No action taken), but PowerShell wasnâ€™t actually sourcing them when it started.

Thatâ€™s why you got:
CondaError: Run 'conda init' before 'conda activate'

â†’ The shell didnâ€™t know what conda activate meant.

âš¡ What the fix did

This command:

& "C:\Users\Client\anaconda3\Scripts\conda.exe" shell.powershell hook | Out-String | Invoke-Expression


Runs conda.exe with the special shell.powershell hook argument.
That prints out a block of PowerShell code (the actual hook functions for conda activate, conda deactivate, etc.).
Out-String | Invoke-Expression takes that code and executes it in your current PowerShell session.
ðŸ‘‰ Essentially, it manually injected the Conda hook that should have been auto-loaded at shell startup.

âœ… Why it resolved the issue

Once the hook was injected, PowerShell understood the conda activate command.
Thatâ€™s why after running the command, your environment (vehicle) activated successfully.
